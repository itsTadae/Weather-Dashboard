# Weather-Dashboard

This project consists of a weather app that is designed to show the 5-day weather forecast for a given city. 

The user can search for a city that they are interested in knowing the weather for the given day, and for the next 5 days. 

In addition to the temperature, the humidity, wind speed, and UV index are shown for the current day in the city.

There is also a search history in which the user can view previously searched cities.
